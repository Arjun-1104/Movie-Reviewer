I am developing a Movie Reviewer application that provides detailed information about movies, including their storyline, cast, and showtimes. This project is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean design and user-friendly interface. Itâ€™s an interactive platform for movie enthusiasts to explore and discover films effortlessly.
